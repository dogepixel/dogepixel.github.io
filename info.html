<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Who are you?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
My name is Condratiy Lenovin, I'm 20 years old and I live in a city Ufa, Russia. I'm interested in the IT world. I'm interested in computers and his world. I support and love OpenSource-software.
I run my own YouTube channel and Instagram account (ConLenov). I also do programming.

<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Why Dogecoin?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Dogecoin has always been an inexpensive currency and 1 doge is worth less than a dollar. Dogecoin is an inexpensive currency for both Western countries and the CIS.
</p>

<p style="color: #03e1e4;">What will you do with the money?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The first thing I would spend money on is the development of the MNTm (M is Not TaskManager) project. The goal of MNTm is to create a OpenSource analog of the Task Manager from Windows 10.<br />

Next, I would use the funds to support OpenSource projects, primarily UBPorts, Wine, ReactOS, RPCS3.

<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Why should I buy your pixels?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Because you will have an image and a link to your site on the homepage of a site that could potentially be seen by many people over the coming years. The site will be online for at least 6 years, that's guaranteed, but the idea is to keep it online forever. So you really could own a piece of 'internet history'!
</p>
<p></p>
<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Why can't I buy one single pixel?</p>
<p>
We decided that although it would probably be cool if individuals could buy a single pixel each, in practise, it wouldn't so effective. The reason we believe this is because you can't display anything meaningful in one pixel - nor click it easily - so visually, it would be pointless. With thousands of random tiny coloured dots all over the place, the homepage would look gastly.<br/>
We also thought that the site would appeal more to people with businesses/websites to advertise than it would to individuals, or to put it more accurately, businesses would pay more to have a meaningful graphic on the homepage. Hence the minimum purchase is 100 DOGE - a 10x10 block.<br/>
However! If you really want to own a single pixel, there is always the option of clubbing together with your friends/family/colleauges and buying a 10x10 block.
</p>

<p></p>
<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Why do you need Million DOGE?</p>
<p>
Why a million moneys - everyone decides for himself. Would you like a million dollars?
