<p>If you're looking for pixels, you've come to the right place! We've got a million of the little things.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pixels on DogePixel are available in 100 pixel 'blocks', with each block measuring 10x10 pixels. You will see the homepage is divided into 10,000 of these blocks. The reason for selling them in these blocks is because anything smaller than 10x10 pixels would be too small to display anything meaningful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(However, if you want to own less than 100 pixels - eg. one pixel - you could always club together with family/friends/colleagues and buy a single 10x10 block.)</p>
<p>Each 10x10 block costs 100 DOGE, equating to a cost of 1 DOGE per pixel. You can buy as many blocks of pixels as you like, as long as there are some available (see the live stats in the top right corner of the page). Please read all of the following T's & C's if you are about to buy some pixels - especially those marked in red. Just so we all know what the score is :)</p>
<p></p>
<p style="color: #03e1e4;">Terms and Conditions</p>
<p></p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ The minimum purchase is 100 DOGE (100 pixels), and the maximum purchase is whatever is left<br />
ðŸ”¹ When you 'buy' my pixels you will not 'own' any part of the homepage or this site, but rather you are granted the right to submit an image and link which will then be published on the homepage in the respective space you have paid for<br />
ðŸ”¹ You cannot change the image or link once you have submitted them, so you must be sure of the image & link you want on the homepage, which will be there for at least 6 years. The only exception is if you have a strong reason why you need a change to your image/link, eg. your site no longer exists, major structural change to your site, lawsuits, etc.<br />
<span class="colortext" style="color: #d735bc;">ðŸ”¹ If your image and link are accepted and published on the homepage, you cannot get a refund</span><br />
ðŸ”¹ If for whatever reason in the future you want your image and link removed from the homepage, you can do that, but you will not get a refund and the space will become publically available again<br />
ðŸ”¹ Images must be the exact size you have paid for (eg. 100 pixels = 10x10 pixels)<br />
ðŸ”¹ Images must be in PNG or JPEG format, and a reasonable file size<br />
<span class="colortext1" style="color: #d735bc;">ðŸ”¹ Images must NOT be animated (imagine how messy the homepage would look)</span><br />
ðŸ”¹ You must have the authority to provide the image and link for the website you submit<br />
ðŸ”¹ Funds must be fully recieved and cleared before your pixels go live on the homepage<br />
ðŸ”¹ Once you have ordered and the funds have cleared, I will aim to get your pixels online within 24-48hrs (but please have patience if things kick off and loads of people order at the same time)<br />
